<objective>
Replace full-height progress bar characters with thinner horizontal lines that don't extend to line edges, creating visual separation between adjacent progress bar rows.

Purpose: User reported progress bars appear to touch each other because full-height block characters (█, ░) span entire cell height. Thinner characters centered vertically create the illusion of spacing.

Output: ProgressBar component uses horizontal line characters (━, ─) instead of block characters.

# Gap details:
# Test 1 failed: "Progress bar rows in roadmap view have minimal vertical spacing"
# User reported: "there is no space at all.. is there an option for a character we could use for progress that is centered, but doesn't go to the top and bottom of the line to give us illusion that they are not touching?"
# Root cause: Uses full-height characters █ (\\u2588) and ░ (\\u2591) that extend to line edges
# Fix: Use horizontal line characters (━ \\u2501 for filled, ─ \\u2500 for empty) that are thin horizontally and centered vertically

<task type="auto">
  <name>Replace progress bar characters with horizontal lines</name>
  <files>src/components/roadmap/ProgressBar.tsx</files>
  <action>
  In src/components/roadmap/ProgressBar.tsx:

  1. Change filledChar from '\\u2588' (full block) to '\\u2501' (box drawing heavy horizontal)
  2. Change emptyChar from '\\u2591' (light shade) to '\\u2500' (box drawing light horizontal)

  These characters are thin horizontally and centered vertically, creating the illusion of vertical spacing between progress bar rows.

  Reference current implementation at lines 19-20.

  Progress bars use horizontal line characters (━ for filled, ─ for empty) that are thin and centered, creating visual separation between rows.

<verification>
Run TUI with `bun run dev` and verify:
- Progress bars in roadmap view appear to have vertical spacing (characters don't touch)
- Progress still visually clear with new characters
- Multiple phases with progress bars show clear separation
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- ProgressBar.tsx uses horizontal line characters (\\u2501, \\u2500)
- Adjacent progress bar rows have visual separation
- Progress percentages still clearly readable
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/06-additional-ui-polish/06-05-SUMMARY.md`
