<objective>
Reduce vertical spacing between progress bar rows in roadmap view to make the interface more compact and less sparse.

Purpose: User reported gap is too big visually, consuming valuable terminal vertical space. A full line of margin (marginBottom={1}) is excessive in terminal UIs where screen real estate is limited.

Output: PhaseRow component with reduced or removed margin bottom prop

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Remove or reduce marginBottom in PhaseRow</name>
  <files>src/components/roadmap/PhaseRow.tsx</files>
  <action>
Remove marginBottom={1} from line 49 in PhaseRow.tsx. The Box component currently has:
```tsx
<Box flexDirection="column" backgroundColor={highlightBg} marginBottom={1}>
```

Change to:
```tsx
<Box flexDirection="column" backgroundColor={highlightBg}>
```

Remove marginBottom entirely rather than reducing it (marginBottom={0} is same as no prop). This eliminates the full blank line between phase rows while maintaining visual separation through the chevron, status icons, and progress bars.

Gap reason: User reported "the gap is too big visually.. what can we do to make it smaller looking?" - marginBottom={1} inserts a complete blank line between rows, making the interface feel sparse and consuming vertical screen real estate.
</action>
  <verify>
1. File has marginBottom prop removed from line 49: grep -n "marginBottom" src/components/roadmap/PhaseRow.tsx returns nothing
2. Component compiles: bun run typecheck passes without errors
</verify>
  <done>PhaseRow renders without marginBottom, progress bars have compact vertical spacing</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Progress bar rows now have minimal vertical spacing, making the roadmap more compact and better utilizing terminal space.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. PhaseRow component no longer has marginBottom={1} prop
2. Visual spacing between phase rows is reduced from 1 full blank line to 0 lines
3. Phase rows remain visually distinct through content structure (chevron, status icon, progress bar)
4. Roadmap view displays all phases with compact spacing
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/06-additional-ui-polish/06-03-SUMMARY.md`
