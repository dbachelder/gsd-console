- **Tasks:** 3 (2 code changes, 1 verification)
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Footer now anchors to bottom of terminal via Flexbox flexGrow pattern
- Active tab shows underline styling for clear visual indicator
- Inactive tabs use dimColor for visual hierarchy
- Header sizing verified as consistent (no changes needed)
