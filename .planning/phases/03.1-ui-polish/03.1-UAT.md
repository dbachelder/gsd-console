## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Sticky footer positioning
expected: Footer should anchor to bottom of terminal regardless of content length. When content is short, footer stays at bottom (not floating in middle).
result: pass

### 2. Active tab underline styling
expected: Active tab (roadmap/phase/todos) shows underline indicator and bold text. Tab is clearly distinguishable as active.
result: pass

### 3. Inactive tabs dimmed
expected: Inactive tabs use dimColor - visually dimmer than active tab. Clear visual hierarchy between active and inactive.
result: pass

### 4. Tab state persistence - detail level
expected: Toggle detail level in Phase view (press 'd'), switch to Roadmap tab, switch back to Phase tab. Detail level should be preserved (not reset to 1).
result: pass

### 5. Roadmap state persistence
expected: Roadmap toggle state (expanded phases) and selection preserved when switching tabs.
result: pass
note: Re-verified after gap closure (03.1-04). Original issue was state not persisting on tab switch.

### 6. Plan list with checkboxes
expected: Phase view shows plans inside the box with completion checkboxes: [v] for completed (green), [ ] for pending.
result: pass

### 7. Plan wave/task info toggle
expected: At detail level 1, only plan name shown. At detail level 2+, wave and task count shown on indented second line (e.g., "  (Wave 1, 3 tasks)").
result: pass

### 8. Plan summaries trimmed
expected: Plan summaries have no leading whitespace. Text starts cleanly after checkbox.
result: pass
