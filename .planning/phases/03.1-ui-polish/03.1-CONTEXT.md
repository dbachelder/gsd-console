# Phase 03.1: UI polish - Context

**Gathered:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

UI refinement for existing TUI — addressing visual polish and state issues from earlier phases (help bar positioning/styling, tab styling improvements, plan file display, tab state persistence, header sizing consistency). No new capabilities; polishing existing functionality.

## Implementation Decisions

### Help bar behavior
- Sticky to bottom of content area (not fixed to viewport)
- Visible by default
- Has a hotkey to toggle visibility (hotkey does not need to be documented in the help bar itself)
- Distinct and visible styling (not subtle/blended)
- Minimal content - active view shortcuts only (not all shortcuts)

### Tab styling
- Active state: Low key visual indication (subtle, dimmed inactive tabs)
- Spacing: Relaxed spacing between tabs (cleaner look)
- Organization: Fixed order (not reorderable)

### Plan file display
- Phase tab shows plans by default (not hidden behind navigation)
- Plan details to show: Summary, task count, wave info if available (make it look good based on what's available)
- Interaction: View plan content inline in TUI (not editor integration)
- Navigation to success criteria/goal: Left to Claude's discretion

### State persistence
- Phase selection: Remember which phase was expanded/selected when switching tabs
- Toggle state: Remember detail level toggle (d key state)
- Scroll position: Remember scroll position when switching back to a tab
- Duration: Session only (no persistence across TUI restarts)

### Claude's Discretion
- Tab visual style (underline vs pill/segmented)
- Navigation depth for accessing success criteria and goal details
- Exact help bar toggle hotkey choice (just needs to exist)
- Header sizing consistency approach (not explicitly discussed in this session)

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- "I don't care about file names, I think we want the plan summary and number of tasks in it.. maybe the wave info also.. see what we have and make it look good"
- Help bar toggle hotkey should exist but doesn't need to be documented in the help bar content itself

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
