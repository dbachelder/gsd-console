# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 03.1-04
    provides: Roadmap state persistence, controlled RoadmapView
provides:
  - Fuzzy file picker with arrow key navigation
  - Cleaner roadmap view without misleading progress bar
  - Success criteria checkboxes that reflect phase completion
affects: [phase-4, opencode-integration]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - useFuzzySearchList hook from microfuzz for filtering
    - Phase completion status passed to child components

key-files:
  created: []
  modified:
    - src/components/picker/FilePicker.tsx
    - src/components/roadmap/RoadmapView.tsx
    - src/components/phase/PhaseView.tsx
    - src/components/phase/CriteriaList.tsx

key-decisions:
  - "Filter clears on Escape, second Escape closes picker"
  - "j/k navigation only when filter is empty (typing mode)"
  - "Phase completion determines all success criteria checkbox state"

patterns-established:
  - "Fuzzy filtering via useFuzzySearchList from @nozbe/microfuzz/react"
  - "Pass parent completion status to child checkbox components"

# Phase 03.1 Plan 05: Gap Closure Summary

**Fuzzy file picker with arrow navigation, cleaner roadmap without progress bar, and accurate success criteria checkboxes**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-25T06:42:44Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-25T06:45:28Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments

- File picker now supports j/k and arrow key navigation with fuzzy filtering
- Removed misleading project progress bar (plan-based percentage was inaccurate)
- Success criteria checkboxes now show green checkmarks when phase is complete

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add arrow key and fuzzy navigation to file picker** - `a36e8c3` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Remove project progress bar from roadmap screen** - `1a3a289` (fix)
3. **Task 3: Fix success criteria checkboxes on phase tab** - `355465e` (fix)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/picker/FilePicker.tsx` - Fuzzy filtering and arrow key navigation
- `src/components/roadmap/RoadmapView.tsx` - Removed progress bar calculation and rendering
- `src/components/phase/PhaseView.tsx` - Pass phase completion status to CriteriaList
- `src/components/phase/CriteriaList.tsx` - New phaseComplete prop for checkbox state

## Decisions Made

- Filter input accumulates as user types; Escape clears filter, second Escape closes picker
- j/k keys work for navigation (not added to filter)
- Number keys 1-9 only work for quick select when filter is empty
- Phase status === 'complete' marks all success criteria as verified (no per-criterion tracking)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - all tasks completed as specified.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- All Phase 03.1 todos addressed (file picker, progress bar, checkboxes)
- Ready for Phase 4 (OpenCode Integration)
- No blockers or concerns
