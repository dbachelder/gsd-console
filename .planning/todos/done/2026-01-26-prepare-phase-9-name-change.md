## Problem

Phase 9 is next in the roadmap but has no plans yet. The project needs to be renamed from "GSD Status TUI" to "GSD Console" as part of public readiness preparation.

## Solution

Research and plan the implementation for Phase 9 name change and public readiness. This includes identifying all files that need updates, planning the rename strategy, and preparing for public release readiness.
