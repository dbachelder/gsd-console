title: Preserve tab state when switching views
area: ui

## Problem

When navigating from the phase tab back to the roadmap tab, the selected phase and toggle state are lost. Users lose their context and must re-select the phase and toggle options each time they switch between tabs.

## Solution

TBD - Need to persist phase selection and toggle state across tab navigation, likely via state management or local storage pattern.
