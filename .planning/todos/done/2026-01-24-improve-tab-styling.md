title: Improve tab styling
area: ui
files:

## Problem

The tab bar styling could be improved for better visual hierarchy and aesthetics. Current tabs are functional but plain.

## Solution

TBD - consider:
- Active tab highlighting (background, border, or bold)
- Better spacing between tabs
- Visual separator or underline for active tab
- Consistent styling with overall TUI theme
