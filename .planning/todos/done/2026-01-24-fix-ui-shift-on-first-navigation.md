title: Fix UI shift on first navigation
area: ui
files: []

## Problem

There is a slight shift in the UI the first time you navigate after opening it. This creates a jarring visual inconsistency during initial navigation.

## Solution

TBD - Need to investigate the root cause of the initial navigation shift and implement a fix to prevent it.
