title: Move session status in footer to its own line
area: ui
files:
  - src/components/Footer.tsx
---

## Problem

Session status indicator is displayed inline with keybinding hints in the footer, making it crowded and hard to read.

## Solution

Move session status to its own line above the keybinding hints for better separation and readability.
