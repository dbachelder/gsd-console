## Problem

Phase 9 is planned as "Name Change And Public Readiness" but currently has 0/0 plans. The project needs to prepare for the final phase which involves changing the project name and making it ready for public release.

## Solution

Research and plan the specific name changes required for public release, including:
- New project name selection and validation
- Documentation updates
- README and package.json modifications
- Public readiness checklist
- Release preparation tasks
