title: Fix inconsistent header sizing
area: ui
files: []
---

## Problem

The header changes size based on the content of the main content area, creating visual inconsistency and a jarring user experience. When main content changes, the header expands or contracts unpredictably.

## Solution

TBD - Need to investigate layout and positioning. May require fixed header height or proper flex/grid layout configuration.
